    <div class="polaroid-card card1">
      <p><br>As someone who aspires to study at an Ivy League school, I realised early on that staying organised isn’t just helpful — it’s essential. However, I struggled with planning, keeping track of deadlines, and managing my time. Most planners felt either too boring or too complicated, and they simply didn’t work for me.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="polaroid-card card2">
      <p><br>So, I decided to design my own — and that’s how My Digital Diaries came to be! <br><br>If my products can help even one student feel calmer, more organised, and more confident in their goals, then this business has done exactly what I hoped it would ♡</p>
    </div>

    <div class="polaroid-card card3">
      <p><br>Thank you so much for supporting me throughout this journey! <br> <br>Every purchase or contribution helps me move one step closer to achieving this goal, and I’m truly grateful for any support ♡</p>
